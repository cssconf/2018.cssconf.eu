            <p>
              We use MailChimp to send our newsletter to our subscribers.
              MailChimp is a service provided by The Rocket Science Group, LLC,
              512 Means Street, Suite 404, Atlanta, GA 30318, USA.
            </p>
            <p>
              The email addresses of our newsletter recipients, as well as any
              other information described in this notice, are stored on the
              servers of MailChimp in the USA. MailChimp uses this information
              for sending and to evaluate the newsletters on our behalf.
              Furthermore, MailChimp can use its own information to check these

              technically optimize shipping and the presentation of the
              newsletter or for economic purposes, in order to determine from
              which countries the recipients come.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data stored when you registered for the newsletter (E-mail
              address, name, IP address, and time and date of registration) will
              be sent to a server operated by The Rocket Science Group in the
              United States and stored there in accordance with the EU-US
              Privacy Shield. MailChimp uses this information for sending and to

              However, MailChimp does not use the data of our newsletter
              recipients to write them down itself or to send them back to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We trust in the reliability and IT and data security of MailChimp.
              MailChimp is protected under the US-EU Data Protection Agreement
              “Privacy Shield” and is thus committed to comply with EU data
              protection regulations. Furthermore, we have created with
              MailChimp a “Data Processing Agreement”. This is a contract, in
              which MailChimp is responsible for to protect the data of our
              users in accordance with their data protection regulations on our
              behalf and in particular not to pass them on to third parties. The
              data protection regulations of MailChimp can be viewed here.

            <p>
              The registration for our newsletter takes place in a so-called
              double opt-in procedure. This means that you will receive an
              e-mail after registration, in which you will be asked to confirm
              your registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one
              can log on with foreign e-mail addresses. The registrations for
              the newsletter are recorded in order to be able to prove the
              registration process according to legal requirements. Therefore we
              store the login and the confirmation time, as well as the IP
              address. Also, the changes to your data stored with the shipping
              service provider (MailChimp) are logged.

              To subscribe to the newsletter, it is sufficient to provide your

              newsletter for personal address.

              Statistical survey and analysis
            </h3>
            <p>
              The newsletters contain a so-called “web-beacon”. A pixel-sized
              file retrieved from the server of the shipping service provider
              when the newsletter is opened. Within the framework of this call,
              technical information, such as information about the browser and
              your system, as well as your IP address and time of the call-up
              are collected.
            </p>
            <p>
              This information is used to technically improve the services based
              on the technical data or the target groups and their reading
              behavior by means of their polling points (which can be determined
              using the IP address) or the access times. Statistical surveys
              also include determining whether the newsletters are opened, when
              they are opened, and which links are clicked. This information can
              be assigned to individual newsletter recipients for technical
              reasons. It is, however, neither our endeavor, nor that of the
              shipping service provider, to observe individual users. The
              evaluations are much more useful for us to recognize the reading
              habits of our users and adapt our content to them or to send
              different content according to the interests of our users.

            <h3 id="cancellation-revocation">Cancellation / Revocation</h3>
            <p>
              We may process your personal data until you revoke your consent.
              You can cancel the receipt of our newsletter at any time, i.e.
              revoke your consent. So that goes out at the same time your
              consents to its dispatch via MailChimp and the statistical
              analyses. A separate revocation of sending via MailChimp or the
              statistical evaluation is unfortunately not possible. A link to
              cancel the newsletter can be found at the end of each newsletter.
              For instructions to take this step, please refer to the
              confirmation e-mail and each newsletter.
