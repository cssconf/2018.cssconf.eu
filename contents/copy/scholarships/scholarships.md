At CSSconf EU, we strive to bring together the most diverse group of people possible — we firmly believe in equality, which is why we invite anyone and everyone to participate. In order to make this possible, we are proud to announce our Scholarships Initiative for people who wouldn’t otherwise be able to attend.

Our scholarships fund will support individuals from underrepresented groups to attend CSSconf EU and/or JSConf EU. Scholarships include a free ticket to the conference that will be awarded after an application process and lottery. Depending on the funds we can raise, we plan to also fully sponsor travel expenses and accommodation, if required.

Anyone from an underrepresented group in tech is invited to apply for a scholarship. This includes, but is not limited to: women, people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, disabled people, and people facing economic or social hardships.

Granting these scholarships is made possible thanks to our Diversity Support Tickets initiative and the generous contributions made by our sponsors. More help is needed – talk to us if you’d like to get involved: [contact@cssconf.eu](mailto:contact@cssconf.eu).

We are very grateful and would like to say a big Thank You to the companies and individuals who donated to our Scholarship Program: ❤️
