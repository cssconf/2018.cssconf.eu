# CSSconf Speaker Guide

# Welcome!

Thank you so much for joining us for CSSconf EU 2018! We're really excited to see you soon in Berlin, but until then, we've created this page to help you with any roadblocks you may be facing on your way there.

# Hotel Information

## [nHow Berlin](https://www.nhow-berlin.com/en/)

*Stralauer Allee 3, 10245 Berlin*

We have booked a room for you from Thursday until Monday (unless you confirmed other dates with us or have private accommodation). In case you need assistance with regards to the hotel, you can contact Simone (TODO: link this to her profile in the contacts section).

If you're arriving by public transport, the closest stations are:

- **Warschauer Straße** (S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Bus, Tram) — This station is serviced by the S3, S5,  S7, and S9 S-Bahn lines, as well as the U1 subway line. It's also a Tram terminus station.
- **Stralauer Allee** (Bus) — Serviced by the 347 bus line.
- **Schlesisches Tor** (U-Bahn, Bus) — Serviced by the U1 subway as well as various city-bound bus lines.

You will only need an *AB Ticket* to get there. For more information, refer to the transport section.

# Venue Information

## Arena Berlin

*Eichenstraße 4, 12435 Berlin*

The entire event, including meals, parties, and everything else takes place in here, so there's no long distances you have to take during the day.

If you're travelling to the venue by taxi, most taxi drivers should recognize the destination if you just say "Arena Berlin". The closest public transport stations are:

- **Treptower Park** (S-Bahn, Bus) — Serviced by the S8, S9, and the Ring lines (S41 and S42). From there, you can walk or take the 165/265 bus lines.
- **Eichenstraße/Puschkinallee** (Bus) — Serviced by exactly those 165/265 lines, as well as the 104 line. From here, the venue is a stone throw away. This station is also reachable from Schlesisches Tor.

# Travel tips

## Travelling by Taxi

If you're going to travel by Taxi (which is recommended if you're staying at the speaker hotel), the most important thing to keep in mind is to always ask the driver for a receipt so that we can reimburse it later! In German, that's "Quittung bitte", but most drivers will understand what you're asking for even in English.

## Travelling by public transport

Berlin has an excellent public transport system comprised of S-Bahn (commuter trains), U-Bahn (subway), Buses, Trams, and even ferries! Here's some important things you want to keep in mind if you plan to use it:

- You should get to almost any place within Berlin in 30-40 minutes. However, keep in mind that Berlin often has demonstrations and strikes, and therefore, some modes of transport might be delayed or sometimes even blocked outright.
- Most modes of transport operate on a trust-based ticket system. This means that there's no ticket checking when you get on, but rather, sometimes ticket inspectors do random checks. If you happen not to have a ticket at that point, that's a 60 Euro fine.
- The above is not usually true for buses — the bus driver will want to see your ticket as you get on, but you can also directly buy tickets from him (only with cash, though).
- Berlin has 3 ticket types: AB will get you anywhere within Berlin, ABC will get you anywhere within Berlin *plus* some cities outside of Berlin (like Potsdam), and BC is irrelevant for you. Usually, AB is fine, but if you're arriving from Berlin Schönefeld airport (SXF), you'll need an ABC ticket to get into the city, and the other way around.
- This isn't a formal rule, but in Germany, you're not supposed to make too much noise in public transport vehicles. People will look at you weird, and sometimes ask you to tone it down.

## Airports

Berlin has two airports:

- Berlin Tegel (TXL), which lies in the north of Berlin, is the busiest and also likely the one you'll arrive in if you come from outside of Europe. It's a small and fairly hectic airport, and one of its biggest downsides is that the only means of public transport connection is via bus. Hop onto the TXL bus (yes, the bus line is called TXL), and you'll be at the main station or Alexanderplatz in no time. Alternatively, just take a taxi (remember, we'll reimburse you for it).
- Berlin Schönefeld (SXF), which lies outside of the city limits in the south, is the low-cost and smaller of the two. Fortunately, it has good train connections, with a commuter train connecting the city centre and the airport arriving every 5-10 minutes. Additionally, there's a regional train that takes you directly to the main station. You can take the commuter train directly until Warschauer Straße and then walk to the hotel from there!

# Things about Berlin that you might want to know

- If you would like to explore the city by bike, the hotel has its own bike rental system. Just ask at the reception desk and you'll be good to go! Berlin is a mostly bike-friendly city, but that can't be said about some of its inhabitants. Be aware at all times and you should be good, though.
- Being a capital city, most people in Berlin speak or at least understand English, so there's no need to learn German just for this event.
- If you need hygiene or sanitary products, most corner shops (colloquially called "Spätis") sell those.
- Generally, if you need anything late at night, those corner shops are open until after midnight and have a good selection of common products you'd need.
