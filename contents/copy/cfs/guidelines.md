## Guidelines

* Language: all talks are in English.
* Talk Duration: talks should be 30 minutes long (for longer talks we’ll get in touch with you directly). We will be on a tight schedule and will enforce time limits rigorously. We suggest that you time your presentation accordingly in advance.
* Formatting: make sure that you care, and make sure we see that it is evident. Typos, sloppy formatting and all-lowercase submissions make our reading of your proposal tedious and will reflect negatively on the outcome of your submission.
* Brevity: don’t get too wordy. If you need more than two paragraphs to get to the point of your proposal, we ask you to slim it down. With the amount of submissions we get, the quicker you can make a good first impression, the better.
* Originality: our aim is to push the community forward and we favor original content. If you want to present a topic that you have talked about elsewhere, try to add a twist or new research / development to it — something that makes it unique.
