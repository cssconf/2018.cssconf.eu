## Mission & Values

CSSconf EU is a not-for-profit community conference run by a team of volunteers. We are all active members of the tech community, and run or contribute to various free local meetups, workshops, and education initiatives. With CSSconf EU, we aim to bring the international CSS crowd together with our beloved local Berlin community. We are humbled to look back to three sold-out events where we welcomed the world’s most excellent CSS speakers on our stage, and we are proud to have always put an inclusive and welcoming culture first. We operate under a Code of Conduct, run a scholarship program, write articles to be transparent, and are committed to diversity and accessibility.

Talks are always in English, and video recordings will be released for free after the event. All speakers were selected via an open Call for Speakers. The voting on all proposals took place in January 2017.

## Festival Area

This year, for the first time ever, we have a Festival Area! We dedicated a part of our large and beautiful venue just to fun activities and short live demos that you can check out during breaks. You’ll be able to: meet the companies that support CSSconf EU, chat with the people behind open source projects / community initiatives, be wooed by { live : JS }, see the CSSconf bags getting printed, take selfies in our photo booth, play foosball, charge up your phones, grab a frozen yogurt and … sit on beanbags!

Supporting Companies: CSSconf EU wouldn’t be possible without the support of great companies: our sponsors! Many of them will be available for chats and demos in our Festival Area. Make sure to stop by at the booths of SinnerSchrader, eBay Tech, Mozilla, Google, Twilio, AMP, Cloudflare, Shopify and Host1Plus.

Community Area: The CSS Community is awesome, and we’re proud to have some fantastic contributors and organizers as our guests. Come and meet them, get a demo, and learn how you can get involved too: Lauren Dorman for Tachyons, Yoshua Wuyts for Choo and Dat, Aga Naplocha for The Awwwesomes, Glen Maddern for styled-components, Katrin Kampfrath for CSSstudies, Bastian Albers for CSSclasses, Jan Borchardt for opensourcedesign, Katharina Jockenhöfer for upfront.ug.

Fun Stuff: We got you covered. During breaks, you can meet the crew behind { live : JS } and explore their audio/visual arts, learn from SDW printshop how the CSSconf bag is printed, take selfies with friends in our photo booth, play foosball, or relax in a beanbag and flip through the latest edition of Offscreen Magazine.

## Social Events

Thursday Warm Up: As it has become our tradition in the past years, we will have a small warmup event on the evening before the conference. Around 7pm on Thursday, we will gather to get some drinks at Volksbar Berlin (Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße 39, 10178 Berlin).

CSSconf EU Dinner: Around 7pm on Friday, after the talks have ended and the big family photo has been taken, we’ll come together for food, drinks and, most importantly, to talk and discuss the events of the day with fellow CSSconf EU attendees. We’ll serve a streetfood-style dinner and snacks, including tasty vegan and vegetarian options, to keep you sated.

CSSconf Closing Party: What would a great day be if it didn’t end in celebration! The party will take place at Glashaus, a river-facing building adjacent to the conference venue, so there’ll be no long walks from dinner to drinks to party. Expect free drinks (except hard alcohol) and music from our DJ @berlindisaster!
Friends, family and the community are also welcome to join us, provided they present a party ticket at the door.

## Accessibility and Childcare

We do our best to ensure that the conference, venue and events throughout the day are fully accessible, so that all attendees can wholly participate in and enjoy the conference. To do this, we work closely with venue and volunteer staff prior to and on the day of the event to ensure disability access to all areas.

As part of our commitment to accessibility, we’re bringing real-time transcription (CART) to CSSconf EU. There will be a live feed of every word of each talk.

We’re happy to be able to offer free, all-day childcare at the venue for children aged 3 and above. For parents with younger infants, we will provide a quiet room equipped with comfy seats, diapers and other essentials where you can retreat to throughout the day.

Berlin’s flat geography, its many bike lanes and the friendly weather in early May make it perfect to get around by bike! Check with your hotel or hostel if they have bikes to rent out, or find your perfect bike at one of the many bike rental places.

Taxis in Berlin are affordable and everywhere. You can usually hail one on the street, or use apps like MyTaxi to order one.
