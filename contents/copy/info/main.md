## Mission & Values

We operate under a [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), run a [scholarship program](/scholarships), write [articles to be transparent](http://blog.cssconf.eu/), and are committed to [diversity](/diversity-support-tickets) and [accessibility](/accessibility).

**Supporting Companies**: CSSconf EU wouldn’t be possible without the support of great companies: our sponsors! Many of them will be available for chats and demos in our Festival Area. Make sure to stop by at the booths of our supporters.

**Community Area**: The CSS Community is awesome, and we’re proud to have some fantastic contributors and organizers as our guests. Come and meet them, get a demo, and learn how you can get involved too.

**Fun Stuff**: We got you covered. During breaks, you can meet the crew behind { live : JS } and explore their audio/visual arts, learn from SDW printshop how the CSSconf bag is printed, take selfies with friends in our photo booth, play foosball, or relax in a beanbag and take a little break.

## Travel & Transport

### Berlin’s Airports

Berlin has two airports, both of which are located close to the city center, a 30-minute taxi ride from the venue (ca. EUR 30). There are also trains and buses that connect the airports to Berlin’s city center.

### Public Transport

Berlin has many public transport options. The subway, trains, buses, trams are all operated by [BVG](http://www.bvg.de/en). We recommend getting one of the [tourist tickets](https://shop.bvg.de/index.php/group/73) for the length of your stay – this will allow you to use all subway trains, trams and buses in all of Berlin, plus it comes with discounts for popular sights, museums, and other attractions.

### Bike

Berlin’s flat geography, its many [bike lanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_in_Berlin) and the [friendly weather in early June](http://www.yr.no/place/Germany/Berlin/Berlin/statistics.html) make it perfect to get around by bike! Check with your hotel or hostel if they have bikes to rent out, or find your perfect bike at one of the many [bike rental places](https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=bike+rental&find_loc=Berlin&start=0&cflt=bikerentals).

### Taxi

Taxis in Berlin are affordable and everywhere. You can usually hail one on the street, or use apps like [MyTaxi](https://de.mytaxi.com/en/index.html) to order one.

## Accommodation

Below are a two hotels we recommend, both a short walk away from our venue. If neither of those fit your needs, check out [HRS](http://www.hrs.com/) or private accommodation options like AirBnB or Couchsurfing.
