## Festival Area

Introduced in 2017, we again will have a Festival Area! Part of the large and beautiful venue will be dedicated just to fun activities and short live demos that you can check out during breaks.

<!-- You’ll be able to: meet the companies that support CSSconf EU, chat with the people behind open source projects / community initiatives, be wooed by { live : JS }, see the CSSconf bags getting printed, take selfies in our photo booth, play foosball, charge up your phones, grab a frozen yogurt and … sit on beanbags! -->

**Supporting Companies**: CSSconf EU wouldn’t be possible without the support of great companies: our sponsors! Many of them will be available for chats and demos in our Festival Area. Make sure to stop by at the booths of our supporters.

**Community Area**: The CSS Community is awesome, and we’re proud to have some fantastic contributors and organizers as our guests. Come and meet them, get a demo, and learn how you can get involved too.

<!-- Fun Stuff: We got you covered. During breaks, you can meet the crew behind { live : JS } and explore their audio/visual arts, learn from SDW printshop how the CSSconf bag is printed, take selfies with friends in our photo booth, play foosball, or relax in a beanbag and flip through the latest edition of Offscreen Magazine. -->

## Social Events

**Thursday Warm Up:** As it has become our tradition in the past years, we will have a small warmup event on the evening before the conference.
<!-- Around 7pm on Thursday, we will gather to get some drinks at Volksbar Berlin (Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße 39, 10178 Berlin). -->

**CSSconf EU Dinner:** Around 7pm on Friday, after the talks have ended and the big family photo has been taken, we’ll come together for food, drinks and, most importantly, to talk and discuss the events of the day with fellow CSSconf EU attendees.
<!-- We’ll serve a streetfood-style dinner and snacks, including tasty vegan and vegetarian options, to keep you sated. -->

**CSSconf Closing Event:** What would a great day be if it didn’t end in celebration! More infos about our evening program soon.

<!-- The party will take place at Glashaus, a river-facing building adjacent to the conference venue, so there’ll be no long walks from dinner to drinks to party. Expect free drinks (except hard alcohol) and music from our DJ @berlindisaster!
