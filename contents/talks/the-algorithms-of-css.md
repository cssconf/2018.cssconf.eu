  title: The Algorithms of CSS

----

“CSS isn’t a ‘real’ programming language,” we CSS developers are often reminded
— we don’t write programs, we describe presentation. Algorithms and CSS, then,
don’t exactly go hand-in-hand…or do they? 

From the cascade to Grid Layout to our own design systems, we may not write
algorithms in the same fashion as other programming languages, but we sure do
use them!

This talk will document a self-taught developer’s mission to bridge the gap
between CSS and Computer Science by way of algorithms. True, CSS is not a
programming language like the others, but an understanding of the fundamentals
can benefit our code just the same.
