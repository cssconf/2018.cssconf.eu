  title: Accessible by Law! Generating Colors with JS and CSS Custom Properties

----

In Norway, all websites are required by law to be accessible. That has inspired
us rather than constrained us when building our video consultation service. How
could we make it easy for users to pick their own brand color, and still make
sure they had sufficient contrast? Combining CSS Custom Properties with a
sprinkle of JavaScript we were able to create a color palette and components
that also meet the WCAG criteria (and learned a lot on the way).
