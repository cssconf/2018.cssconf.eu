  title: It's Dangerous To Go Alone! Take This Team

----

What makes a team successful? Innovative? Great?

As software developers, many of us spend a fair amount of time working alone
behind our computers, but when we come together as a team we can build truly
great products for people. So how do we build effective teams?

In this talk, we’ll explore the concept of “safe” teams and how they enable us
to build and design software faster and with more innovation than other teams.
We’ll see how these concepts apply not just to our day jobs but also to the
larger Open Source and CSS communities to which we belong.
