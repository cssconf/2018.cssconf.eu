  title: Design Systems as Facilitators.

----

We build design systems to help our teams communicate to accomplish a shared
goal—often, in the case of web development, improving a product. Design systems
provide shared reusable patterns aimed to reduce code bloat and establish
harmony across applications. However, the most significant benefit to building
a design systems is that they create resiliency and dynamic conversations
across our teams. A good design system is the first step to establishing
autopoiesis—a cybernetic feedback loop—within our design and development teams
and organization, which is a requisite for maintaining a viable system. By the
end of this talk, I hope we will see how the act of building and maintaining a
design system not only aids our teams but takes us one step closer to
reimagined futures.
