  title: The Web Is Not Just Left-to-Right

----

This talk traces the parallel history of western and eastern typography from
handwriting to the internet age, setting the context for how the web is a brand
new medium for typesetting. CSS allows us to implement advanced typographic
features and multi-directional layouts, that not only benefits
internationalisation, but opens up a myriad of options for creative and
interesting layouts in general as well.
