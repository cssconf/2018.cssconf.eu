    Container Queries: The Past, Future, and How You Can Actually Even Use Them
    Today

----

Container queries have been one of (if not *the*) most requested CSS features
for several years now, and yet there are no specifications attempting to design
them nor browser vendors attempting to implement them. Why is that?

The truth is that while high-level CSS container query APIs aren't currently
being worked on, several low-level web primitives are being developed that will
make container queries possible. In this talk I'll present the history of
container queries, explore the challenges they present, and show you how
several new browser APIs actually do make container queries possible today.
