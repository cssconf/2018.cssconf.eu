    Preprocessors, Components, and CSS in JS or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying
    and Love the Website

----

Behance's codebase has existed in various states for over 7 continuous years -
which includes multiple major redesigns, brand overhauls, backend framework
changes, JavaScript frameworks, CSS preprocessors, templating languages,
feature births and deaths, product integrations, and more.

And now, we are working on our latest project: moving our JavaScript and Sass
to Vue.js and CSS Modules.

This talk explores our journey over the years, from how we choose which
technologies to implement, how we piecemeal large rewrites while maintaining
developer sanity and website integrity (and how to cut corners gracefully), how
we manage technical debt, and finally, how to be at peace with the reality of a
fragmented codebase.
