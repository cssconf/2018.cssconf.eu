  title: Strategy Guide for CSS Custom Properties

----

Static variables are not always global, but global variables are almost always
static, therefore dynamic variables should almost always be local. Did you
follow that? If not, you might need to see my talk. I will cover HOW to use CSS
variables correctly for things like: theming, responsive design, prototyping,
animation and much more. A practical guide that tells you more than how the
syntax works.
