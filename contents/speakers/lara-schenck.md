[Lara Schenck](https://notlaura.com) is a freelance Front-end and WordPress
developer living in Los Angeles. She is passionate about exploring how code
works and loves to share her findings through teaching, writing, and
mentorship.

A self-taught developer, Lara questioned the place of traditional Computer
Science knowledge in the work of a web developer, particularly with regards to
technical interviewing. Over time she found that an understanding of the
fundamentals is an investment well-worth making. Lara inspires all of us who
work with the web to seek a deeper understanding of the code we write and the
tools we use.
